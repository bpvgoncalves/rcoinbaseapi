## Overview

This document summarizes all known Coinbase API endpoints and indicates which ones are currently wrapped by the `rcoinbaseapi` package.

**Legend:**

- ‚úÖ Implemented (Wrapper function available)
- ‚è≥ Planned or partially implemented
- ‚ùå Not yet implemented
- üï∏Ô∏è Deprecated or replaced by newer version

> Even when no wrapper exists, you can still use the `apirequest()` function directly to interact with any supported endpoint.

## REST APIs
### API v2: Coinbase App API Endpoints

The **v2 API** is Coinbase‚Äôs older interface for account balances, pricing, and wallet operations. While still live, many endpoints are deprecated in favor of newer v3 APIs.

### API v3: Advanced Trade API Endpoints

The **v3 API** unifies account management, order placement, and trading under the `/api/v3/brokerage/` path. This is Coinbase's actively developed API and is the recommended interface for both basic and advanced use cases.

## Notes

- Even if no wrapper exists, you can call any endpoint via `apirequest()` by specifying the path and HTTP method.
- Endpoints are grouped logically by API version and use-case.
- Deprecated v2 endpoints are retained for completeness but not recommended for new development.
